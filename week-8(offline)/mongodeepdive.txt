Good question to have at this point
Why don’t we let the user hit the database directly?
Database
Give me all posts for myself
What extra does the http server provide exactly?
1. Databases were are created using protocols that browsers don’t understand
2. Databases don’t have granual access as a rst class citizen. Very hard to do user specic access in them
3. There are some databases (rebase) that let you get rid of the http server and try their best to provide granola access

Databases usually allow access to 4 primitives
1. Create Data
2. Read Data
3. Update Data
4. Delete Data
Popularly known as CRUD

In mongoose, first you have to define the schema
This sounds counter intuitive since mongodb is schemaless?
That is true, but mongoose makes you dene schema for things like autocompletions/
Validating data before it goes in the DB to make sure you’re doing things right
Schemaless Dbs can be very dangerous, using schemas in mongo makes it slightly less dangerous
