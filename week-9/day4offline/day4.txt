everyone shifted from class based to function based in React

<> </> => fragments
we cant return multiple items (div,components etc in react though we can wrap all of them inside a single div we cant do like below)
return(
    <div></div>
    <div></div>
)
but we can do this
return(
    <div>
        <div></div>
    </div>
)

if we dont want div as parent element and want to have multiple childs without parent div we can use fragments
