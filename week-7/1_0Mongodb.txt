# What are databases

Databases are organized collections of data that are structured to enable efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information.

Whenever you create a `full stack app` , you  `persist` data in `databases`. 

For example - 

1. User information
2. TODOs of your todo app
3. Posts for facebook
4. Tweets for twitter

## Types of databases

- **Relational Databases**: Use tables to store data and relationships between data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Designed for more flexible data models and often used for big data or real-time web applications (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Graph Databases**: Store data in nodes and edges to represent relationships (e.g., Neo4j).
- **Vector Databases**: Used in ML to store data in the form of embeddings

# MongoDB and NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases are a broad category of database systems that diverge from the traditional relational model used in SQL databases. 

They are designed to handle a variety of data models and workloads that may not fit neatly into the tabular schema of relational databases.

## Properties
schema is what a database look like
- **Schema Flexibility:** NoSQL databases often allow for a flexible schema, meaning you can store data in formats that don't require a fixed structure.
- **Scalability:** Many NoSQL databases are designed to scale out horizontally, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers and handle large volumes of traffic.

# MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented approach. Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can have nested structures and varied fields.


# Seeding data in the DB

Lets put some data in the `Cluster` manually

1. Create a new `Database` called `todo-app`
2. Create two collections inside it
    1. `users`
    2. `todos`
3. Seed some data inside the collections

# CRUD Operations

CRUD operations in MongoDB refer to the basic operations you can perform on documents within a MongoDB database. CRUD stands for:

1. **Create**: Adding new documents to a collection.
2. **Read**: Retrieving documents from a collection.
3. **Update**: Modifying existing documents in a collection.
4. **Delete**: Removing documents from a collection.
